## Script for controlling fan in Raspberry Pi by gpio (setup with transistor)

I've changed some properties to works with Celsius.

This python script is an alternative to the Bash script
for fan temperature control, and may serve your needs better!

Thanks to [Michael Nadler](https://github.com/mhnadler) for writing this
and allowing it to be posted here!
